HR Analytics Dashboard using Tableau

Welcome to my GitHub repository showcasing my latest project, an HR Analytics Dashboard created using Tableau.

I which we extract the insights to conquer the problem of Attrition in company.Attrition refers to the process of employees leaving a company or organization voluntarily or involuntarily.

The HR Analytics Dashboard has been built using Tableau, a popular data visualization tool that allows for interactive and dynamic dashboards. The dashboard includes multiple visualizations such as bar charts, heat maps, and scatter plots to help users easily interpret the data.

To use this dashboard, simply upload your HR data into Tableau and connect it to the dashboard. You can then easily filter and drill down into specific metrics to gain a deeper understanding of your organization.

This project is a great example of how data visualization can be used to enhance decision-making and drive organizational success. I hope this repository inspires others to leverage the power of data analytics in their own work.
